/*
 Short Explanation:
Problem: Distribute candies to employees based on ratings, ensuring:

Each employee gets at least 1 candy.

Employees with higher ratings than neighbors get more candies.

Approach:

Use two passes:

Left-to-Right: Give more candies if an employee has a higher rating than the left neighbor.

Right-to-Left: Give more candies if an employee has a higher rating than the right neighbor.

Result:

Sum the candies from both passes to get the minimum total candies required
Complexity:
Time: O(n)

Space: O(n)
